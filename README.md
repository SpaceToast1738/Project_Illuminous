# Project_Illuminous

A random project, being created to run off an arduino...

Currently Working on:
- Bug Fixes for issues listed below. (May potentially have to revert: Research Stages)*
- Improving code efficiency.

Current Issues:
- LEDs dont reset once 5v is broken (could be something to do with: "If the pin isn't connected to anything, digitalRead() can return either HIGH or LOW (and this can change randomly).")

*If that is the case the button would need to be connected too 2 pins (1 Output && 1 Input) That gives a variable setting of the output pin giving the input pin stable readings... An idea for next time (there may have to be a registered voltage but under 3.3v to avoid errors).

Collaborators: TurnipAnnihilation, Connern, Tom.
